# heroku-server-render

A Leiningen template for creating web applications intended to be hosted on
Heroku using Postgres for storage.

It includes:

* [Bidi][bidi] for request routing.
* [Hiccup][hiccup] for server side html templating.
* [Friend][friend] for authentication and authorisation.
* [Korma][korma] for database queries.
* [clj-sql-up][cljsqlup] for database migrations.
* [Http-kit][httpkit] for serving web.

Additionally [foreman][foreman] is used for configuration and environments.

## Usage

For development first set up the database.

```sh
foreman run ./scripts/db/start
foreman run ./scripts/db/create
foreman run ./scripts/db/migrations/run
```

Then start a repl and connect from your editor.

```sh
foreman run ./scripts/repl
```

There's a comment in `core.clj` that you can execute to get a dev server
running.

```clojure
(in-ns 'your-project.core)
(server)
(def server (-main "8080"))
```
